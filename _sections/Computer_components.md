#### Processor

##### Basics of a CPU

Processors, or CPU's, are the "beating heart" of a computer, and as such, perform many more tasks than the ones that will be discussed in this text. The focus lies on the floating point calculation capabilities and the memory subsystems, as well as the interfaces.

The traditional CPU ([Central Processing Unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit)) is an Integrated Circuit (IC) that executes the logic, [arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic), input/output (I/O) and control operations that are prescribed by software running on the computer. As time passed, many other subsystems of computers got integrated into the processor package (die), making the functions that the traditional CPU performs only a subset of all the functions that a modern processor performes. A "core" of a modern processor is a separate unit that performes all the tasks of a traditional CPU.

Modern processor cores are very diverse, complex and multi-faceted, varying wildly with ISA, microarchitecture, intended platform and manufacturer. A discussion about CPU's that would include all these variations would be impossible, necessitating a confinement. This discussion will try to be as generic as possible, but the focus lies on an Intel based server CPU of the "Skylake-SP" microarchitecture.

Intel dominates the PC/laptop as well as the HPC/Supercomputer CPU market, making the restriction towards an Intel x86-64 based CPU justified. Considering the fact that almost all Laptops and workstations contain CPU's that are (to a varying extend) derived from their server oriënted counterparts, focusing the discussion around a server CPU seems logical as well. The Skylake-SP microarchitecture was chosen because it is very recent (at the time of writing), contains some very significant advancements for scientific computing workloads and is used in a cluster available to the MEFD group at the TU/e.

##### System on a Chip

Modern processors are best decribed by the ["System on a Chip" (SoC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip) moniker, containing many of the core components of a computer. As such, most contain the following subsystems:

 - Cores
 - Memory controller
 - Cache
 - Interfaces
 - Graphics (included in most consumer oriënted CPU's)

##### Instruction set architecture

An Instruction Set Architecture ([ISA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture)) is an abstract model of a computer and contains a collection of machine instruction definitions. Examples of common ISA's are x86-64, x86 and ARM, with x86-64 being the most common ISA for CPU's in servers, as well as consumer oriënted computers.

An ISA is one of the most important aspects of a CPU, because it formes the link between software and hardware. ISA's where introduced to make programming software easier, which could now be written in terms of ISA instructions in stead of low level [machine code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code). This made it possible to execute the same computer program on different computers, without any modification of the code.

An implementation of an ISA, called a [microarchitecture (uarch)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarchitecture), is the hardware based realisation of these machine instruction definitions (disregarding [microcode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcode)). Any specific uarch can also support extensions to its ISA, common examples are VT-d, AES-NI, SSE4 and AVX2. These extensions are additions to the abstract computer model of an ISA and contain specific instructions to accelerate certain tasks of a computer, like AES data encryption, virtualization and vector mathematics.

Some better known examples of microarchitectures are [Intel i386](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_80386), [Intel Nahelem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nehalem_(microarchitecture)), [Intel Haswell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haswell_%28microarchitecture%29), [AMD K8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD_K8), [AMD Bulldozer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulldozer_(microarchitecture)) and [AMD Zen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_(microarchitecture)). 

##### Threads and cores

A [thread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)) is a chain of instructions that is to be executed by the CPU. Each thread is generated by a process, which can loosely be described as an instance of a computer program. A single core of a CPU can execute one thread at a time, but using a technique called timeslicing and the concept of [context switching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_switch), can handle multiple threads concurrently.

Multithreading (software) allows a single process to spawn a multitude of threads, deviding the workload of that process. Performance benefits (can) arise when these threads are executed in parallel on multiple cores of a CPU.

The specifications of a CPU may contain references to the number of threads it "has", which should be interpreted as the maximum amount of threads it can "execute" at the same time. The fact that a single CPU core can only execute one thread at a time doesn't change, even if the CPU specifications state that it has more (twice) threads then cores. This has to do with a hardware based technique called simultaneous multithreading ([SMT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_multithreading)), which will be discussed later.

##### Cache

Quick access to data is critical for the performance of a CPU, making data flow and storage a mayor aspect of a CPU. The main memory of a computer has a relatively high latency and low bandwidth compared to the needs of modern CPU cores, which is where [cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache) comes into play.

Cache is storage subsystem of the CPU and acts like a data buffer. It contains, among other things, copies of the data that the CPU (or process) "predicts" it will access often or in the near future, reducing the loading time of that data. The amount of cache placed on the CPU is relatively small, typically about 1:1.000, compared to the amount of main memory placed in a computer. A "cache-miss" refers to the situation where data is requested, but not stored in cache, resulting in a much longer loading time. Avoiding cache-misses is a large part of software (and hardware) optimization and can lead to very substantial performance improvements.

Cache memory pressure (memory nearly full) and the ever increasing speed of CPU cores lead to the development of multiple levels of cache. This layered structure has the advantage that it can address both the memory pressure problem as well as the demand for faster data access, without resulting in prohibitive costs. The upper most layer of cache, L1, has gotten significantly faster over time, but did not really increase much in capacity. The lowest level of cache, typically L3, saw the highest increase in capacity, but is also substantially slower then L1.

The development of multi-core processors and several levels of cache created an additional task for cache; inter-core data communication. Each core has its own private parts of L1 and L2 cache, whereas L3 cache is shared between the cores. This last level of cache is the place where data can be shared between the threads running on the different cores.

Cache memory is a lot faster, and generally superior on many fronts, compared to main memory, because cache is made from SRAM and main memory is made from DRAM. SRAM stands for "Static Random Access Memory", whereas DRAM stands for "Dynamic Random Access Memory". Each SRAM memory cell requires 6 transistors to store a bit, whereas DRAM requires only one transistor (and a small capacitor) per bit. The downside of DRAM is that the capacitors in DRAM memory need to be recharged frequently, causing delays and other problems. This constant refreshing of the stored data gave rise to the name "Dynamic", while "Static" was used for SRAM, because it doesn't need to be refreshed. The extra hardware complexity of SRAM allows it to be much faster than DRAM, but the extra cost and space requirements on the [die](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_(integrated_circuit)) of the CPU also make it much more expensive.

##### Execution units and FMA3

Execution units of a CPU core are the parts that execute the machine instructions derived from the thread running on the core. There are many different types of execution units in modern CPU cores, each with their own specific function. Notable examples of execution units are; arithmetic logic unit ([ALU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_logic_unit)), address generation unit ([AGU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_generation_unit)) and floating-point unit ([FPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_unit)). Discussing the functions and operations of all these execution units is beyond the scope of this text, which will focus on the floating-point execution unit.

The floating-point execution units found in modern Intel CPU cores are FMA3 units (from Haswell onwards). These Fused Multiply Add units are capable of three different operations:

 - $ a = a \cdot c + b $
 - $ a = b \cdot a + c $
 - $ a = b \cdot c + a $

A single CPU core can contain multiple execution units of the same type, the exact amount varying with each microarchitecture. The Skylake-SP uarch contains 16 FMA3 units for "double" floating-point numbers and 32 FMA3 units for "single" floating-point numbers. These FMA3 units are seperated into two groups called AVX-512 FMA units, which form the hardware layer of the [AVX-512](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVX-512) ISA extension.

##### Simultaneous multithreading

Simultaneous multithreading (SMT), also known as [Hyper-Threading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-threading), is a technique aimed at increasing the utilization of a CPU core. Each physical CPU core represents multiple logical CPU cores, fully transparant to the Operating System ([OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system)). Every logical CPU core gets their own thread assignment by the OS, meaning that a single CPU core is tasked with multiple threads. Switching between the assigned threads takes place when the running thread encounters a data request that requires multiple clock cycles to fulfill. The state of the current thread is saved after the data request and the state of the new thread gets loaded, allowing the CPU core to continue working on the new thread. This (should) prevent the execution units of the CPU core from being idle during data requests.

The amount of logical cores per physical core differs from microarchitecture to microarchitecture. The most common is two logical cores per physical core, but Intel [Xeon Phi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xeon_Phi) and IBM [POWER9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POWER9) based designs have 4 and up to 8 logical cores per physical core.

The performance improvements generated by SMT vary wildly with applications, from a factor of two down to the negative range. SMT has the largest positive effect in situations where cache-misses are frequent and the workloads of the threads are very heterogeneous. Math routines provided by highly optimized libraries, such as the Intel Math Kernel Library ([MKL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Math_Kernel_Library)), generally don't fall into this catagory, making SMT less viable for HPC purposes.
