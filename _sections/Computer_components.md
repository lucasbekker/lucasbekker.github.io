#### CPU

![CPU](../image/CPU+Legend.png){:width="600px"}

This example CPU is the [Intel Xeon E5-2667v3](https://ark.intel.com/products/83361/Intel-Xeon-Processor-E5-2667-v3-20M-Cache-3_20-GHz). 

It contains:

 - 8 cores and 16 threads.
 - 20 MB L3 cache
 - 40 PCI-e 3.0 lanes
 - Quad channel DDR4 ECC memory controller
 - 2 QPI 9.6 GT/s links

The CPU is the "beating heart" of a computer, and as such, performes many more tasks than the ones that will be discussed here. The focus lies on the floating point calculation capabilities and the memory subsystems, as well as the interfaces.
